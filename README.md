# Creating a Scientific Report with LaTeX


All you need to start a scientific report (no matter if you want
to get a Bachelor, master or PhD thesis) is this. Add what you
need when you need it. This is a very simple example, some would
call it template. I don't.

The pdf file shows the initial layout, this is the LaTeX standard
and can be cusotmized. 


A much more complex template for the same purpose can be found on
[LaTeX templates](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis).
Some things are good, some things are bad.


Some title page examples  can be found in [title page examples](https://github.com/johannesbottcher/titlepageExamples/).
